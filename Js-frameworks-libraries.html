										<h1>Js frameworks and libraries</h1>

								        <h2>Which framework or JavaScript library to choose for my developments?</h2>

									<p>When you are starting to develop web applications, suddenly you realize that with only HTML and CSS you can not do much, you need JavaScript.</p>
									<p>But as soon as you start to research about this language you realize that it forms a brutal ecosystem, and you feel lost among so many bookshops, frameworks, plugins, etc. I have written this article to guide you in this jungle that is web development (In its Frontend part mainly).</p>
									<h2>Vanilla JavaScript</h2>
									    <span class="image main"><img src="images/JS-fr-lib/vanilla-ban.png" alt="" /></span>
									<p>Vanilla JavaScript es como se conoce al lenguaje JavaScript cuando se utiliza sin ninguna librer√≠a o framework.</p>
									<p>At the beginning it was the only way to use JavaScript in web pages, but little by little it has gotten complicated.</p> 


									 <hr class="major" />
		
									<h2>jQuery</h2>
                                        <span class="image main"><img src="images/Js-fr-lib/jquery-ban.png" alt="" /></span>
									 
									<p>It is not a framework as such, since it does not implement any design pattern, it only serves to make some expressions easier. The bad part is that many developers got used to this type of programming and forgot how it was implemented in natural JavaScript.</p>
									    
									<p>An example of the use of jQuery is for example when we want to select an element of the DOM with the id "myElement":</p>
									    <span class="image main"><img src="images/Js-fr-lib/cn-js-ve.png" alt="" /></span>
									<p>The jQuery syntax is easier to remember but causes you to forget how JavaScript works in the long run</p> 
									
									<h2>jQuery Mobile</h2> 

									<p>jQuery also launched jQuery Mobile which was basically a reduced version of jQuery and optimized for mobile devices that were just beginning to emerge.</p>  

								    <p>jQuery Mobile had a predecessor that was jQuery UI, a set of resources both CSS and JS to implement graphical interfaces. The mobile version was an adaptation of this one.</p>

								    <h2>The War of CSS Frameworks</h2>

								    <span class="image main"><img src="images/Js-fr-lib/bot-vs-font.png" alt="" /></span>

								    <h2>Bootstrap</h2>
								    <p>This framework was created by a Twitter employee and released as Open Source. Its popularity is due to the ease of layout that involves using its CSS classes, as well as the visual design of the main HTML elements of any web page. It is very useful to carry out small projects and test their operation before investing in design.</p>
								    <h2>Foundation</h2>
								    <p>Foundation is the other great fighter in this battle for control of CSS.</p>
								    <p>Its operation and use is similar to Bootstrap, and both one and the other improve the other each time they change the version. At the time, the Foundation was better because it better implemented the Mobile First pattern and the HTML tags for the different elements. Then came Bootstrap and with his version 3, improved this part. Currently Foundation is in version 5 where it has a specific section for WebApps, but is preparing version 6, like Bootstrap version 4, where both will use Flexbox CSS to position elements on the website, which will improve much more your performance</p>

								    <h2>The arrival of JavaScript Frameworks</h2>
								    <p>jQuery was and still is widespread, but as web applications implemented more and more functionalities and complexity, jQuery became unmanageable. AJAX calls, view changes, etc.</p>
								    <p>The MVC design pattern (Model, View and Controller) was beginning to be needed in the Frontend when it had always been a matter of Backend. Several emerged, but the one that stood out and continues to occupy an important part in the cake is Backbone</p>

								     <hr class="major" />
								    <h2>Backbone JS</h2>
                                        <span class="image main"><img src="images/Js-fr-lib/back-b-js.png" alt="" /></span>

								    <p>It was created by Jeremy Ashkenas, author of the Underscore bookstore, and the CoffeeScript precompiler. Backbone owes its popularity to that it is an extremely light framework (7 Kb) compared to others, and it allows you to use the system of templates you want, other libraries, etc ... it is quite flexible</p>

								    <hr class="major"/>
								    <h2>Ember JS</h2>
								    <span class="image main"><img src="images/Js-fr-lib/ember-ban.png" alt="" /></span>
								    <p>Ember is another framework of the MVC family. I do not know him very much because I have not worked with him, but the bases are similar to Backbone. It is very popular by the developers in Ruby on Rails.</p>

								     <hr class="major"/>
								    <h2>Angular js</h2>
								       <span class="image main"><img src="images/Js-fr-lib/ang-js-ban.png" alt="" /></span>

								    <p>Angular was the last to arrive and ended up beating Backbone. It is a project initiated by Google and quickly became very popular. Angular brought integrated functionalities that using JavaScript Vanilla or BackboneJS needed other libraries to implement it.</p>  

								    <p>Angular provides its own module system, it is not necessary to use Require.JS as it might be needed in Backbone. It also brings its own template system, it is not necessary to implement Mustache, Handlebars, etc ... It provides its own services to bring data via AJAX, without the need for external liberias.</p> 
								    <p>With the arrival of NodeJS and its popularity, the MEAN stack formed by Mongo as Database, Express and NodeJS as server language and framework and AngularJS for the client part. This stack has become as popular or more as it was in its day the LAMP stack (Linux + Apache + MySQL + PHP).</p>

								    <hr class="major">
								    <h2>And NodeJS arrived</h2>

								    <p>Node.js was a revolution in the world of web development. Of repende the programmers who were in charge of the Frontend part of the applications could enter the world Backend, since NodeJS is the way to be able to program with JavaScript in the server.</p>
								    <p>In addition to the backend world, with NodeJS several tools were developed to improve the developments and make them more agile</p>
								    <h2>Grunt</h2>
								    <p>At one point we had Grunt to automate repetitive tasks such as file mining, concatenated, preprocessing of other languages such as CoffeeScript to JavaScript, or Sass, Less, Stylus to CSS.</p>
                                         <span class="image main"><img src="images/Js-fr-lib/gu-gr-ban.png" alt="" /></span>
								    <h2>Gulp</h2>
								    <p>After Grunt came Gulp, using the Streams provided by NodeJS made it easier to implement and execute the tasks we did before with Grunt.</p>
								    
								    <h2>Browserify</h2>
								    <p>In the middle of these two great emerged Browserify, a library that allowed to bring the programming mode that was being used in NodeJS to the client side. Now you could import modules with the require command without having to have a long list of scripts in the HTML.</p>

								    <h2>Webpack</h2>

								    <p>We currently have Webpack that incorporates in a few steps what we most repeated in Gulp, such as transpiling, preprocessing and minifying. Webpack has achieved that, depending on the type of project, you do not need neither Gulp nor Browserify.</p>

                                    <p>And it offers something very interesting, the Hot Loader, allowing us to see the changes we make while developing, without losing the status of the application. Something that Gulp does not allow us to do.</p>

                                     <hr class="major">
								    <h2>Hybrid web applications?</h2>
 
								    <p>The rise of mobile applications, Android and iOS, made some frameworks evolve and new tools appeared. At one time there were many tools that allowed a web to be packaged as a mobile app (Phonegap), but the user experience and use was hell.</p>

								    <h2>IONIC</h2>
								        <span class="image main"><img src="images/Js-fr-lib/ionic-ban.png" alt="" /></span>

								    <p>Luckily, Phonegap evolved to Cordova, and Ionic emerged, a library based on Angular that allows us to create mobile applications for Android and iOS programming only in JavaScript and packaging it with Cordova. Everything is great, we can do single-page applications with AngularJS, program the backend and frontend using JavaScript, even mobile applications without changing language or stack.</p>  
								    
								    <p>But developers do not like to sit still ...</p>  

								    <h2>The emergence of the WebComponents</h2>
								        <span class="image main"><img src="images/Js-fr-lib/webco-ban.png" alt="" /></span>

								    <p>Webcomponents or web components, are a specification of the W3C to compose the web and reuse elements that we use in our day to day. Today we have forms, inputs, tables, headings, etc. But increasingly new patterns of designs, repetitive and there is no standard for that.</p>

								    <p>In our webs we all have menus, navbars, maps of google maps, videos of youtube, etc ... Your HTML code is illegible, becoming a mountain of nested divs</p>

								    <p>The WebComponents try to solve that, and this specification arose at the same time that AngularJS and its directives</p>

								    <h2>Polymer</h2>
								       <span class="image main"><img src="images/Js-fr-lib/poly-ban.png" alt="" /></span>

								    <p>As the WebComponents are a standard in review, is not implemented 100% in all browsers and that is why Polymer came up, another Google project to bring the development of WebComponents to all browsers.</p>   

								    <p>Currently its version 1.0 is already available with many improvements and components.</p>

								    <p>it is no longer just a Polyfill but a library to facilitate the use and implementation of WebComponents. There is also the Polymer Starter Kit which is a point of arrance, and a way to see if you really need native apps or with a mobile web (without packaging) can be as versatile as the native.</p>

								    <h2>React</h2>
								        <span class="image main"><img src="images/Js-fr-lib/react-ban.png" alt="" /></span>

								    <p>Its popularity is growing by leaps and bounds, due in large part to the speed of rendering, as it uses a Virtual DOM for it.</p>
								    <p>React is not a framework like Angular, it is only a library (such as jQuery, or Polymer) designed only for the graphical interface. You can combine it with any framework or use Vanilla JavaScript.</p>
								    <p>Facebook for its part designed Flux, an architecture to create web applications with React, but without using any Framework, only pure JavaScript without additions. The design pattern provided by React is to compose our applications (It is not the same as webcomponents).</p>
								    <p>Do not think about a complete MVC for the application.</p>

								    <hr class="major"/>
								    <h2>The JavaScript standard evolves</h2>
								    <p>JavaScript started as a language to add animations and interaction in a web page. Now web pages are applications and JavaScript falls short, hence the birth of frameworks such as Angular, or precompilers like CoffeeScript to translate to JavaScript.</p>

								    <h2>ECMAScript6 (ES6 or ECMAScript 2015)</h2>

								    <p>JavaScript needed a revision and finally it has come true. For several years the new version of the standard has been defined, ECMAScript 6, which provides classes, modules, new functionalities, etc. It has been achieved (to some extent) that it is not even necessary to use frameworks to develop, only with libraries we can have a very powerful stack. Like all specifications, it takes time to implement, and although it was approved in July 2015, many browsers still do not have all the improvements that it brings.</p>
								    <h2>Isomorphic applications</h2>
								    <p>React is growing a lot in a short time. Its way of implementation allows to use the library in the server part with Node JS, which allows us together with other libraries like React-Router and React-Engine, to create components that can be reused both in the Frontend and in the Backend, which is known as isomorphic or universal applications.</p>

								    <h2>At the end the market dictates the option</h2>

								    <p>In these cases I always say that you choose the library, language, tool with which you feel most comfortable. Forget about fashions, and use what makes you more productive and above all have fun developing.</p>
